            <p>How many of you have received flowers for Valentine's Day? Of course, February in New England is snowy, and those flowers are not raised locally&mdash;they are imported from other countries. International trade is hugely important in national and international economies today, but up to this point it has been excluded from our models. In this lecture, a basic introduction to the principles of international trade is provided.</p>

        ansSel: ["Country 1.", "Both countries.", "Neither country."],

        ansSel: ["Marginal rate of substitution.", "Price ratio.", "None of these."],
        ansInfo: "The correct answer is the marginal rate of transformation. The marginal rate of transformation captures the rate at which one output good could be transformed into another output good if resources were re-assigned."

        ques: "When an import tariff is imposed on a good that is imported by a given country, which of the following quantities decreases?",
        ans: "Consumer surplus and social welfare.",
        ansSel: ["Consumer surplus.", "Producer surplus.", "Social welfare."],
        ansInfo: "Both consumer surplus and social welfare will decline when a tariff is imposed. Consumer surplus declines because consumers pay higher prices for products they purchase. Producer surplus will increase, but not sufficiently to outweigh the decline in consumer surplus, and overall social welfare will decline due to deadweight loss."

        ques: "Which of the following can be a source of comparative advantage in international trade?",

        ansSel: ["Endowments of natural resources.", "Endowments of labor.", "Technological differences."],
        ansInfo: "Differences in endowments of natural resources, labor or technological differences can all be the source of a comparative advantage for a country in producing a given good."
