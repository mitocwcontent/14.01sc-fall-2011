Session Overview
----------------

| ![lec13.jpg]({{< resource_file 71791b27-7001-2076-ea7c-f29871eeabb5 >}}) |  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} When changes occur in a market—whether they are shifts in demand, shifts in supply, or government policies that interfere in the market's workings—they affect the welfare that market participants gain by virtue of being in the market. We can understand these changes by analyzing producer and consumer surplus, and this is the focus of this lecture. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} _Taxicab medallions are distributed and restricted by the government, and have an impact on social welfare.

### Concept Quiz

This concept quiz covers key vocabulary terms and also tests your intuitive understanding of the material covered in this session. Complete this quiz before moving on to the next session to make sure you understand the concepts required to solve the mathematical and graphical problems that are the basis of this course.

##### Question 1
 {{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ1" >}} Consumers will generally have consumer surplus that is highest when the demand curve has what characteristic? {{< quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Downward-sloping.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Highly elastic.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}Highly inelastic.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Horizontal.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_solution >}}A horizontal demand curve signifies high elasticity, but consumer surplus is lowest in markets where demand is highly elastic. A downward-sloping demand curve is normally characterized by an intermediate degree of elasticity.{{< /quiz_solution >}} {{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
##### Question 2
 {{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ2" >}} In the long-run, producer surplus is equal to what quantity? {{< quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Marginal cost.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}Profits.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Revenue.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Total cost.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_solution >}}In the long-run, profits are equal to producer surplus. Profits are not equal to total cost or revenue (they can also be calculated as revenue minus total cost, but that option is not included here.) Marginal cost is relevant to the determinant of the profit-maximizing point of production, but it does not directly determine profits.{{< /quiz_solution >}} {{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
##### Question 3
 {{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ3" >}} What is the definition of social welfare? {{< quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Dead weight loss.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}The area above the supply curve.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}The difference between producer and consumer surplus.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}The sum of producer and consumer surplus.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_solution >}}The difference between producer and consumer surplus may be of interest from the point of view of equity, but it is not a well-defined concept in welfare economics. The area above the supply curve is also not well-defined. Deadweight loss is potential surplus that is lost due to market-distorting policies.{{< /quiz_solution >}} {{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
##### Question 4
 {{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ4" >}} When is social welfare maximized? {{< quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}In a competitive environment with price restrictions.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}In a competitive equilibrium.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}In a monopoly.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}When the long-run supply curve is upward-sloping.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_solution >}}It is important to note that if the government places price restrictions on a given market, this will result in deadweight loss corresponding to trades that are not made.{{< /quiz_solution >}} {{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
##### Question 5
 {{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ5" >}} In the market for taxis, the government regulation that every taxi driver owns a medallion is a restriction on trade. This results in a change to social welfare in the medallion market. How can you describe that change? {{< quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}A decrease in deadweight loss.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}A transfer of surplus from consumers to producers.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}An increase in deadweight loss, and a transfer of surplus from consumers to producers.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}An increase in deadweight loss, and a transfer of surplus from producers to consumers.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_solution >}}First, there is deadweight loss because some trades are not made (some additional people would like to take cabs, and some additional people would like to drive them, but they cannot because they do not have medallions.) Second, the restriction on the entry of taxi drivers raises the prices of a taxi ride, and this is a transfer from the consumer to the producer.{{< /quiz_solution >}} {{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
