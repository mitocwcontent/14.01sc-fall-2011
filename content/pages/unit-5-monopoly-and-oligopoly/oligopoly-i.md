            <p>We have already learned about the operation of two very different types of markets: perfectly competitive markets and monopolists. However, most markets don&rsquo;t fall into either category. For example, think of the market for soda - both Pepsi and Coke are major producers, and they dominate the market. This type of market structure is known as an oligopoly, and it is the subject of this lecture.</p>

        ansInfo: "The correct answer is that a reaction curve relates the optimal quantity produced by one firm in an oligopoly to the optimal quantity produced by the second firm. It shows the relationship between the optimal quantity produced by each of two firms operating in a Cournot equilibrium. The other three answers correspond to concepts that are relevant for a monopolist or a competitive market, but not in an oligopoly."

        ansInfo: "The dominant cooperative equilibrium strategy in the Prisoners' Dilemma is that both players keep silent. However, given that we generally assume that players cannot cooperate, the dominant non-cooperative equilibrium is that both players speak to the police."
